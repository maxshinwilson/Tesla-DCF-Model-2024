## Methodology

This model follows a standard enterprise DCF framework:

- Free cash flow to the firm is projected over five years
- Terminal value is calculated using a perpetual growth model
- Enterprise value is converted to equity value using net cash

Assumptions are made conservative and based on recent performance rather than historical peak growth rates.
